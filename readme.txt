Blocks scaffolded with Create Block tool.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a custom Investment post type, which uses a block template for its content, and two custom blocks to display Investment details.

The Filterable Investments Gallery block displays a filterable grid of all Investment posts.

The Investment block is a standalone block that can be used in a page or post to showcase investment details. It is not tied to any Investment custom post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/custom-filterable-investments-gallery` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
